# Asian Hate Crime Reporter Demo

This project was made in a team of 4 for the 2021 NEHS Hackathon. It's a proof of concept for a proximity-based reporting tool for Asian hate crimes in someone's local area. While it did not win any awards in the NEHS hackathon, it did win the First Place Award in the 2021 Spring 2021 Shui Mu Youth Competitions for Science and Technology.
